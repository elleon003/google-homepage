# The Odin Project Web Development 101

## Project: HTML/CSS (Difficult)

This repo displays the results of my first project working through The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

While I've done a few sites in my learning path, this is the first time I tried to clone an existing site from scratch.

There is so much to be learned! In this site, I felt I gained a better understanding of

- Chrome Developer tools (Lifesaver for layout ideas!)
- CSS pseudo-elements (like ::before, ::placeholder, & :hover)
- Flexbox
- Placing images in input fields (that took me FOREVER)
- Playing with cursors
- Planning your classes and ID's
  - *This was a big one - in previous projects, I just made up classes and id's as I went along. For this, however, I had to sit down and get a first draft of ideas before diving into the skeleton of the layout.*

There were also a few things I had to give up on to avoid perfectionism:

- We weren't supposed to focus on hover effects, but I had to try. That said, I was never able to get the SVG icons for the top menu to work properly.
- In more hover action, I gave up on the over over the mic icon in the search field
- Finally, I couldn't get the bottom page numbers to lineup with the extended Google logo. It seemed that the actual page was using a table that lined up the individual letters with a page number, and I just didn't have the care by that point!

On the whole, I'm proud to have completed this. Thanks for reading!
